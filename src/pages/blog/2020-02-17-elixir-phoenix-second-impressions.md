I last looked at Elixir and Phoenix in 2017. The community was just starting to pick up steam, and coming from a Rails background, I was generally intrigued by the promise of productivity, maintability, and performance.

I worked through the Exercism and How I Start problems, but despite really enjoying my first impressions, I thought the technology was too new and risky to push for at work, and I didn't have an immediate side project to work on, so I shelved it for the time being.

Fast forward to 2020, I was digging around in technologies and decided to give Elixir and Phoenix a second look. Here's a list of my current impressions that I'll keep updated:

## ♥️Love
* Pipe Operator / Pipelines 😍
* Contexts
* Testing
* Performance
* Functional programming
* Ecto
* Lisp-style macros
* OTP
* Sane websockets
* Community
* Documentation

## 🤷‍♂️Could Be Improved
* Authentication library
* Cryptic stacktraces
* Community Presence
* Elixir as a general utility language
* Static-typing

## 👍Conclusion
[TBD]
